# AccessMap — feature backlog

The next things to build, ordered roughly by value vs. cost. One vertical
slice per item. Keep each spec to a single sentence — flesh it out only
when you (or an agent) picks it up.

This file is the source of truth for what to build next. If something is
"in progress" or "shipped (unmerged)", note it inline; remove items once
they land on `main`.

---

## Now (next 1–2 runs)

- **Marker clustering on the Map.** Cluster pins when more than ~50 are
  in the viewport so pan/zoom stays smooth at high density. Native: wrap
  `MapView` with `react-native-map-clustering`. Web: hand-roll with
  `supercluster` (react-leaflet has no native primitive). Adds two
  runtime deps — DECISIONS FOR SKY. Detailed plan in
  `qa-reports/qa-2026-05-22.md` P4.
- **Realtime flag updates.** Subscribe to Supabase realtime channel for
  `public.flags` so a flag created/triaged on one device appears on
  others without a manual refresh. The publication SQL is committed
  as [`supabase/realtime.sql`](supabase/realtime.sql) with the team's
  privacy + RLS analysis + rollback inline. **Sky: run that file in
  the Supabase dashboard SQL editor when ready** (one button-press,
  idempotent). Then a small extension to `FlagsProvider` merges
  incoming row deltas.

## Next (this month)

- **Default-filter-set on launch.** With saved sets in place, let the
  user mark one as the default so the app opens to that view instead of
  the last-toggled state.
- **Distance test coverage.** `src/lib/distance.ts` doesn't have a
  test file yet (Loop 5 didn't add one). Add one when Jest is in.
- **Address search / jump-to.** Geocoded address bar at the top of
  Map; tapping a result animates the map there.

## Later (sequence after the above)

- **Offline / PWA support.** Cache recent flags + the OSM tiles seen
  recently so the app works on a flaky connection.
- **Push notifications on flag updates.** Reporter learns when their
  flag is verified or resolved. Requires an Edge Function + push token
  storage — DECISIONS FOR SKY.

## Shipped recently (2026-05-23)

All items below merged to `main`. Not back-listed unless something
broke.

- Categories / severity legend on the Map.
- Persistent flag-load error banner on the Map.
- Filter flags on the Map by status.
- Accessible list view of nearby flags + auto-open for screen readers.
- Profile editing (display name, default tab, prefer-list-view).
- Reporter points toast on triage.
- My Reports view from Profile.
- Flag detail modal in Tasks.
- Photo lightbox.
- Shared FlagsProvider with `setStatuses` + optimistic helpers
  (`patchFlag` / `removeFlag`) + stale-fetch race protection + iOS
  screen-reader error announce.
- Tasks tap-to-retry error banner (replaces one-shot `Alert.alert`).
- Backported `errorMessage()` helper consolidating ~11 catch-block sites.
- **Persist Map filters across app launches** (Loop 2).
  `src/lib/mapFilters.ts` + hydration gate in MapScreen.
- **Distance + ETA on Tasks cards** (Loop 5). `src/lib/distance.ts` +
  `src/lib/location.ts` (`useUserLocation` hook). NearbyFlagsModal also
  rewired to the shared util.
- **Saved named filter sets** (Loop 4). `src/lib/filterSets.ts` + UI
  row in the Map filter panel. Cap of 5 sets, tap to apply, long-press
  to delete.
- **Jest + jest-expo test runner.** 108 tests across 8 suites pass on
  `npm test` (errors, flags, onboarding, points, preferences,
  severityColor, mapFilters, filterSets). `tsconfig.json` no longer
  excludes the `__tests__/` tree so tests type-check too.

## Conventions

- Born accessible — labels, roles, contrast, 44pt targets, reduced motion.
- Match the existing patterns: screens in `src/screens/`, data in
  `src/lib/`, map only through `PlatformMap`, types use `type` (not
  `interface`).
- Schema / RLS / new-dependency / auth changes are **propose-only** —
  never apply them silently.
